# Streamdeck for Cheap
## How to use!
First of all, this is not the best script you will find out there nor the most optimized, but it is definetive the cheapest one, you only need a PC as a server you want to have a streamdeck for and a phone, like I do a RaspberryPi Zero 2 W and a screen or any other device that has a screen and the power to run a browser that you can use.
It is also important that port 8000 is open in the netwok and all devices connected to this Streamdeck are in the same network. That's just for security, you can of cause also open it to all networks or recode it so you use it as a form of hotspot.

## Structure
IDK if it's needed in a project so small like this one but here a structure section for you!
###### Sever (important for all)
- server/check.py
- server/main.py
- server 

###### Client (ignore every "Client" in PI02 if you manually open the website on use)
- PI02/check.py
Is installing everything from requrements.md if it isn't allready.
- PI02/main.py
The stuff that is controlling everything.
- PI02/util.py
Things like loggin (not in use) and starting the machine the server is on.
- PI02/browser.py
Start of the Chromium-Browser.
